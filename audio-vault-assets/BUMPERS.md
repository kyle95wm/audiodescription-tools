# AudioVault Bumper Guidelines

We use two bumpers to help identify our work as an AudioVault Original:

**Head Bumper**  
Narration: *"An AudioVault Original"*  
â†’ Goes at the start of the file.  
â†’ Duration (no silence): **00:00:01.37**  
â†’ Includes ~1 second of silence baked in.

**Tail Bumper**  
Narration: *"This track is an AudioVault Original. It can be downloaded for free from audiovault.net."*  
â†’ Placed at the end of the file, followed by 1 second of silence.  
â†’ Duration (no silence): **00:00:06.14**

## Want to contribute your own bumper read?

You're welcome to record your own versions! Here's what we ask:

- Submit the **raw, unprocessed mono WAV** files.
- Must be recorded at **48 kHz, 24-bit**.
- **Do not** add or pad with silenceâ€”we'll handle that during mastering.
- Feel free to voice one or both bumpers.
