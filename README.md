# Audio Description Tools

This repository contains a collection of scripts designed to convert subtitle and audio description (AD) files between various formats. These tools are intended to streamline the workflow for AD professionals by automating the conversion of subtitle files to and from formats such as SRT, SMPTE, Excel, and others. In addition, these scripts may also help with converting/muxing AD tracks back into the source video file for distribution.
